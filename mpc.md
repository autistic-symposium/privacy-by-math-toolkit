<br>

### introductory texts

<br>

* **[a pragmatic introduction to secure multi-party computation, by evans et al.](https://securecomputation.org/docs/pragmaticmpc.pdf)**: comprehensive book introducting mpc, protocols such as yao's garbled circuits, gmw, bgw, prepocessed multiplication tiples, bmr, information-theoretic garbled circuits, implentation techniques, oblivious data structures, malicious security, and threat models
* **[cryptographic computing, by aarhus univ](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/crycom/)**
 **[secure multiparty computation, by lindell](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/300.pdf)**: review what MPC is, what problems it solves, and how it is being currently used, including details on shamir secret sharing, honest-majority mpc with secret sharing, output reconstruction, threshold cryptography
