## halo2

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* halo2 us based on ultraplonk and uses several plonkish functions.
* it replaces the kzg polynomial commitment with inner-product argument, which has weaker security assumptions than plonk.
* halo2 does not need setup and implement a powerful recusive proof function. therefore, zkevm can improve the time and efficiency of generating block proof.
