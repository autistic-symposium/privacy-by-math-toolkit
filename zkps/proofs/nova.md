### tl; dr

<br>

* nova is the state of the art and high-speed for recursive snarks, using R1CS arithmetization, it can be thought of as a preprocessor for zksnarks.
* nova can shrink the cost (in number of r1cs constraints) of checking N instances of a problem to one instance of the same problem.
