## zk rollups overview

<br>

### tl; dr

<br>

* lower gas fees (by tx baches and submitting minimal on-chain data)
* higher throughput (fast tx speeds, reduced confirmation times, up to 100x)
* fastter confirmation time (no need to wait for block confirmations on the base layer, finality on l2)
* privacy (no info about the tx is leaked, concealing tx amounts and recipients)
* proof generation costs can be high (reducing proof generation costs involves using more efficient proof systems or circuit designs or incentivizing provers).
* high circuit complexity can affect zk-rollups' scalability and usability
* compatibility issues (not fully compatible with existing smart contracts or tools)
